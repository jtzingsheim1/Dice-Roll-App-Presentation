# Dice-Roll-App-Presentation README


## Overview

This repo contains my work from the week 4 project from the
[Developing Data Products][1] class from Johns Hopkins University within the
[Data Science Specialization][2] on Coursera. The original instructions for the
project can be found beneath the brief description section below. RStudio was
used for all parts of the project.

## Brief Description

The project required two deliverables - one of which is an application which is
located in another [repo][3]. The second deliverable is a presentation pitching
the merits of the app, and this repo contains the files associated with the
presentation portion of the project. The original instructions for this part of
the assignment are shown below. We were free to choose our own topic, and I
decided to make a simple game based on the rolling of two dice. The repo
contains the Rpres file that was used to build the presentation along with the
associated markdown file. The repo also contains folders and files for the
images and figures used in the presentation. The presentation uses the R
presentation feature within RStudio.

>## Peer-graded Assignment: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch
>
>This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a `Shiny`
application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use `Slidify`
or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your
application.
>
>### Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation
>
>OK, you've made your `Shiny` app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5
slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to
create a web page using `Slidify` or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.
>
>Your presentation must satisfy the following:
>
>* It must be done in `Slidify` or Rstudio Presenter
>* It must be 5 pages
>* It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
>* It must contain some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the
document
